    SLO (Service Level Objective) Dashboard
    ❖ Led the frontend development for Redfin’s first SLO Dashboard from scratch, and since release, it has been used by every team at Redfin to visualize and tune their features’ SLOs.
    ❖ Developed reusable React components and Reflux stores to propagate dynamic SLO data to datatables and graphs, while handling user interactions with the dashboard such as form submission and table filtering.
    ❖ Utilized asynchronous data calls and request versioning to speed up the SLO dashboard page load by 7x, and drastically improved its usability as more SLOs were getting onboarded.
    ❖ Implemented a code design pattern for managing nested React forms, in an effort to break down responsibilities of the main React store into multiple single-purpose ones and increase code readability.
    ❖ Iterated on user/engineer feedbacks after the release to stabilize the platform and enhance its accessibility to all users.
    SLO Ingestion Pipeline
    ❖ Independently investigated into a missing data issue with the SLO data ingestion pipeline, and the solution permanently fixed 30 problematic SLOs and increased ingestion accuracy for many others.
    ❖ Developed a data verification job in JavaScript that runs alongside the SLO data ingestion job, as it periodically verifies, reports, and re-ingests if any missing data is detected in the pipeline.
    Elasticsearch (Logging Platform) Disk Quota Program
    ❖ Designed a Python program that automatically controls disk usage for each logging service, saving hours of oncall time each week trying to prevent machines from running out of disk.
    ❖ Developed Python scripts to aggregate disk usage data from Elasticsearch API, auto-delete log indices based on the quota configuration, and report important metrics to monitor the disk health for each service and the logging platform.
